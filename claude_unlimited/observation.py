"""Classifies upstream response metadata into explicit Observation types.

Pure, deterministic, no I/O. Takes only response metadata — the status code
and an allowlist of header values the Proxy module extracts — never response
bodies. That is what lets the Daemon forward request and response bodies as
opaque streams while still making Rotation decisions from structured data.

Only a usage snapshot at or above the threshold, or quota exhaustion,
triggers Rotation. A bare rate-limit never does.
