    silently dropping a bad row — a mapping that half-applied would be worse
    than one that refused.

    Accepts BOTH shapes so old config files and export bundles keep working:
      * the current ORDERED LIST of rows [{claude_model, model?, effort?,
        claude_effort?}, ...] — the editable parity list; order is preserved;
      * the legacy sparse dict {claude_id: {model?, effort?, claude_effort?}}.
    openai_models.normalize_parity() turns either into the in-force row list at
    read time, and the empty case ([]/{}) means "the default rows"."""
