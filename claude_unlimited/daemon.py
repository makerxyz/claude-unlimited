"""The daemon's HTTP surface: /health, the Dashboard management API (/api/*),
and the live proxy (everything else, e.g. /v1/messages) via Gateway.

Route namespaces are strictly partitioned: /api/* (management, CSRF and Host
checked, never touches an Anthropic credential) and everything else (proxy,
placeholder-token checked, never touches the Dashboard's CSRF token) share a
listener but never share auth logic.

Security posture:
  - Binds to 127.0.0.1 only, and refuses any other bind target loudly.
  - Every request's Host header must name this daemon, which blocks
    DNS-rebinding attacks from a malicious page in the same browser.
  - No CORS headers are ever sent, so no origin gets cross-origin access.
  - State-changing requests (POST/PATCH/DELETE) require a per-run CSRF token,
    generated at daemon start, never persisted, and embedded only in the HTML
    this daemon serves.
  - Every response sets Cache-Control: no-store and a strict CSP.
  - Profile JSON responses never include a credential value; Profile has no
    such field (see config.py) and secrets live only in secret_store.
