"""Claude Unlimited CLI: daemon lifecycle, plus two deliberate exceptions.

Profile CRUD (list, edit, delete, threshold, priority, enable) has no CLI
surface and happens exclusively in the Dashboard. `add-account` (alias `ac`)
and `reauth` are the exceptions, because an OAuth browser handshake needs
interactivity — opening a browser, waiting for a redirect — that a JSON API
triggered from a page does not fit. `add-account` creates one Profile and
`reauth` re-authenticates an existing one; everything else about a Profile
goes through the Dashboard, over the same config.py and secret_store.

# --- Claude desktop app, third-party inference mode -------------------------
#
# "3p" is the app's own term for third-party inference: pointing it at a
# gateway instead of Anthropic directly. In that mode it runs from a SEPARATE
# userData directory, `Claude-3p`, with its own settings, session and bundled
# Claude Code. That separation is why searching the normal `Claude` directory
# for these settings finds nothing.
#
# Schema below is not guessed — it was read back out of the app after
# configuring it by hand through Developer > Configure Third-Party Inference.
# Where the app keeps each profile's userData, per OS. Windows is NOT
# symmetrical with macOS and the difference is not a guess - it was read off a
# configured Windows 11 install: the normal profile lives in Roaming, the 3p
# profile in Local. On Windows the app is also shipped as an MSIX package, so
# its writes to %APPDATA% are redirected into the package's LocalCache; that
# redirection is transparent in both directions (verified by writing a probe
# file into %APPDATA%\Claude and seeing it appear in the package view), which
# is why writing to the plain paths below reaches the packaged app.
