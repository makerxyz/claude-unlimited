"""Pure Rotation decision logic. No I/O, no credentials, no network.

choose() picks which Profile should serve the next request. observe() folds
an Observation (see observation.py) into updated per-profile state. Neither
touches an upstream, a keychain, or a clock beyond what is passed in, which
is what keeps them deterministically testable.

Rotation rules:
  - Sticky: stay on the current Profile until its switch_threshold is crossed
    or it returns quota-exhausted.
  - Never rotate on a bare short rate-limit; that Profile gets a cooldown,
    not a state change away from ELIGIBLE.
  - Tie-break among equally-eligible Profiles: lowest priority number wins;
    among equal priority, whichever has the freshest (or no) usage snapshot.

    or one of its subagents) — used only by distribute-mode routing.

    Unlike choose(), this is deliberately NOT sticky and NOT "first by
    priority": its job is to spread branches so one account isn't drained
    while another sits idle. Ordering, in force:

      1. fewest branches currently pinned to it (`branch_counts`) — the
         spreading rule, and it has to come FIRST. Any other leading key
         (priority, utilization) is the same for every branch of a session,
         so every branch would pick the same winner and "each subagent gets
         its own account" would quietly become "all of them share one".
         Count-first makes the assignment round-robin: each account takes a
         branch before any account takes a second.
      2. priority band — decides the order WITHIN a round, so the user's
         preference still says who is used first, second, third.
      3. least-utilized first (`last_usage_percent`) — accounts are limited
         by usage windows, not request count. A profile with no observation
         yet sorts as 0.0, so a fresh account is preferred over a part-spent
         one at the same priority.
      4. `_reset_sort_key` — the same last resort choose() uses.

    A depleted account can't be pulled in by this: candidates are ELIGIBLE
    only, so exhausted, draining and cooling-down accounts are already out.

    `branch_counts` is passed IN (derived by Gateway from its pin map) rather
    than read here: this module stays pure — no I/O, no clock, no mutable
    cross-request state — so it remains deterministically testable.

    Candidates must be ELIGIBLE and `automatic`: a manual-only Profile is
    never auto-assigned to a branch (that's what `automatic` means), which is
    a deliberate difference from choose()'s current-pointer exception.
    `exclude` carries the ids already tried and failed for this request, so
    failover picks a genuinely different account. `fit` (see RequestFit)
    rules out the accounts whose backend cannot hold this conversation, the
