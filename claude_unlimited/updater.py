"""Checks for, downloads, verifies and installs a new release.

TRUST ROOT — the decision this feature was blocked on, made explicit:

  1. The source is hardcoded. GITHUB_OWNER/GITHUB_REPO below are constants,
     never read from config, never from a response body, never from an
     environment variable in a normal run. Nothing an attacker can write to
     `~/.claude-unlimited/config.json` can point the updater somewhere else.
  2. Every network call is HTTPS with certificate verification (the stdlib
     default). Redirects to a non-HTTPS URL are rejected.
  3. The downloaded tree is verified by content, not by trusting the
     transport twice. The release API names a commit SHA; git clones the tag
     and reports the SHA it actually got. Git objects are content-addressed,
     so a tree whose bytes were altered in flight cannot produce the expected
     SHA. The install only proceeds when the two agree.
  4. The previous installation is kept and restored if the new one fails to
     import, so a bad release degrades to "still on the old version" rather
     than a broken daemon.

What this deliberately does NOT claim: it is not a signature check. It
proves the code came from this repository's history as GitHub reports it;
it cannot prove GitHub itself, or an account with push access, is honest.
A detached-signature check can layer on top of step 3 later without
changing anything else here.
